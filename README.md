A Spotify alternative which encourages listening to albums as they were intended, removing ads and scrambling from the music listening experience.

This is my Year 12 HSC Software Engineering Major Project, made with Flask and a SQLite database in the backend, which aims to liberate online music listening from megalomaniacal corporations. It is free, simple, does not require an account or a membership to use and, most importantly, allows users to listen to any song or album chronologically, without ads or random songs in the queue.
